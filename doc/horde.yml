  A package for broadcasting status updates and content to various social
  network services.
description: >
  The package provides a simple definition of a content element that can be
  pushed to a number of social network services. This will not leverage some of
  the more complex features the supported services provide but instead focus on
  a simple status and content update. The content element provides a bridge to
  quickly broadcast content curated within your own account.
